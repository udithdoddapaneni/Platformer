ID1110 Course Project

Platform game

1.	Introduction
a.	Objective: To make a simple 2D platform game like Mario using python.

b.	Motivation: In the beginning of the second semester we had a Game-Dev session organized by YACC, the coding club of IIT Palakkad. In that we used Godot engine which has its own language called Gdscript whose syntax is very similar to python. Using that we made an amazing platform game in less than one week. When the project was announced, the first thought that came into my (Udith) mind was this: Can such a game be made in python? So we decided to make a similar game in python


2.	Project Overview

    a.	Project goals and scope: Our initial goal was to just make a simple game that had simple features like moving left and       right, jumping, gravity and collisions and a few other features if time left. But as these things got finished quickly, we       started adding more and more features like enemies and our ambition grew. We are planning to continue this project even after     evaluation.

3.	Methodology
  a.	Approach and methodology employed: Object Oriented Programming

  b.	Tools, technologies, and frameworks used: Pygame, Tkinter and os modules and Microsoft paint software and online                 transparent image converting tool is used(Link mentioned in the references)


4.	Conclusion and Future Work

a.	Assessment of project success: 

So far we believe that our project was a success given the time we had for making this. But I think we still we have many things left over like adding animations.

b.	Lessons learned and recommendations for future improvements:

With the help of this project we got learn about modules like Pygame and a bit about Tkinter.  We have also learnt about the difficulty and limitations in implementing some seemingly simple but tricky tasks such as collisions and jumping. We have also learnt about some properties of image like opacities and used them to implement things like collisions with the help of masks.

But still it was a lot difficult task to do almost everything through only coding. So after the evaluation we are planning to port this game onto Godot engine to make things simpler. In Godot things like adding a following camera and animations are very easy compared to pygame where we have to code everything manually.

6. Story: Year 2550, the protagonist named protag is a famous time traveller. One day he came in between a conflict between nations fighting in the time travel void and his soul got thrown into another verse into a body of robot. Now he has to traverse the nightmare verse filled with flying grass planes, traps shooting fireballs and floating magma beings that shoot fireballs, through doors to escape out. He has only got a crossbow.

7. Controls and instructions:
    left arrow key for moving left
    right arrow key for moving right
    up arrow key for jumping
    space for shooting an arrow
    shift for activating shield
    
    player has 500 stamina and 500 health
    
    attack costs 250 stamina
    
    jump costs 100 stamina
    
    shield costs 450 stamina
    
    stamina regenerates overtime
    
    one fireball takes 100 health way
    
    getting in contact with the enemy will kill the player
    
    shield protects against fireball but not against enemy's contact
    
    health doesn't regenerate
    
8. Requirements:
    a. Python 3(3.6 or higher recommended as pip comes along with it): https://www.python.org/downloads/
    b. Pygame: pip install pygame
